# My Spring Boot Web Application

This project is a hands-on guide to building a web application using **Spring Boot 3**. In this project, I'll cover the fundamentals of creating a **REST API** that communicates with a database, explores various Spring features, and includes thorough testing. By completing this project, I aim to solidify my understanding of Spring Boot and use it as a foundation to build more complex, enterprise-grade applications.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a web application that tracks user activity and provides useful insights via a RESTful API. The core functionalities include:

- Building and running a **Spring Boot** project
- Implementing a **CRUD** API for tracking user data
- Integrating a database using **Spring Data** and **PostgreSQL**
- Writing comprehensive tests to ensure code reliability and stability

## Key Topics and Features

### 1. Project Setup
- **Build Tools**: Maven or Gradle
- **Spring Boot DevTools** for fast application reload during development
- **Application Structure**: Organize code effectively with best practices for controller, service, and repository layers.

### 2. REST API Development
- **Spring MVC**: Creating endpoints for a fully functional API.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implementing Create, Read, Update, Delete operations.
- **Data Validation**: Ensuring clean and valid inputs for API requests.
- **Error Handling**: Managing exceptions and user-friendly error messages.

### 3. Database Integration
- **PostgreSQL**: Connect the application to a PostgreSQL database using **Spring Data**.
- **Docker Compose**: Set up a local PostgreSQL instance for development and testing.
- **Command Line Runner**: Loading initial data into the database.

### 4. REST Client Integration
- **RestTemplate** and **WebClient**: Making API calls to external services.
- **GraphQL Client**: Experimenting with GraphQL for modern data fetching patterns.

### 5. Testing
- **Unit Testing** with `@SpringBootTest` to test various components.
- **Integration Testing** for REST API endpoints.
- **Test Suites**: Focus on both in-memory and database-driven tests to ensure robust functionality.

## Prerequisites

- **Java**: Basic knowledge of Java (at least JDK 17+)
- **Maven/Gradle**: Familiarity with build tools
- **Postman/HTTP Clients**: For API testing
- **Docker**: Required for setting up and running the PostgreSQL database

## Tools and Technologies

- **Spring Boot 3**
- **Java 17+**
- **Maven/Gradle** for dependency management
- **PostgreSQL** for database
- **JUnit** and **Mockito** for testing
- **Docker** for containerized database setup

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java`: Contains all Java classes, including controllers, services, repositories, and models.
- `src/test/java`: Contains all unit and integration tests.
- `resources/application.yml`: Configuration file for database and other environment settings.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
  
2. **Navigate to the project folder**: 
   ```bash
   cd <your-project-directory>
3. **Build and run the application**:
	```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run	# for Maven users
    ./gradle bootRun        # for Gradle users
4. **Access the API**:
By default, the API will be available at http://localhost:8080.

## Testing the API
To test the API, you can use:

- Postman or cURL to manually test the endpoints.
- JUnit for automated unit and integration testing.

## Future Enhancements
This project is just the beginning! Here are some possible future additions:

- User authentication and authorization using Spring Security
- Front-end integration with React or Angular
- Deployment to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS or Heroku)
